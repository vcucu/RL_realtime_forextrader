# Reinforcement learning use in real-time API data
## Project for the Research Methodology course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology

### Abstract
This  project investigates  the  applicability  of  algorithms  previously  tested  in  theoretical environments  with  unrealistic  conditions. Namely, the  algorithms  investigated  are  deep reinforcement  learning  with  feed  forward  neural  networks  and  recurrent  neural  networks  as these attain the highest results in the recent research.  The testing is done in real time on the simulated trading platform Oanda using a free public API with the updates frequency set to fifteen seconds.  This allows monitoring of how well the algorithms handle time latency in placed orders and price updates, the differences between real ask and bid prices and transactions costs. In addition, the performance is evaluated not only in terms of profit but also in terms of Sharpe ratio, thus taking into account the risk level the agent undergoes.
